# Future Development Plans
# =========================
# The following are ideas for expanding Slingshot Hero based on research into similar games and user feedback:
#
# 1. **New Levels and Environments**: Introduce multiple levels with different layouts, obstacles, and challenges.
#    - Example: Levels with moving platforms or hazards like spikes.
#
# 2. **Additional Enemy Types**: Add new enemies with unique behaviors, such as flying enemies or enemies that shoot back.
#    - Inspiration: Enemies from games like Super Monkey Ball or Worms.
#
# 3. **Narrative Elements**: Add a storyline or mission objectives to give context to the gameplay.
#    - Example: A quest to defeat the sky snake and save the kingdom.
#
# 4. **Visual Feedback**: Implement particle effects or animations for ammo impacts, such as explosions for piercing ammo or sparks for bouncy ammo.
#    - Inspiration: Visual effects from Angry Birds or Worms.
#
# 5. **Multiplayer Modes**: Explore cooperative or competitive multiplayer modes where players can team up or compete against each other.
#    - Inspiration: Multiplayer mechanics from Worms or Super Monkey Ball.
#
# 6. **Optimizations**: Use Pygame's DirtyRect for partial screen updates in high-density scenarios to improve performance.
#
# 7. **Time-Based Mechanics**: Expand on the feathershot platform expiration by adding more time-based elements, such as temporary power-ups or time-sensitive objectives.
#    - Inspiration: Time manipulation mechanics from Braid.
#
# 8. **Enhanced UI**: Add a more detailed UI with health bars, ammo indicators, and possibly a mini-map for larger levels.
#
# 9. **Sound Effects and Music**: Incorporate sound effects for actions like shooting, jumping, and snake movements, along with background music to enhance immersion.
#
# 10. **Achievements and Unlockables**: Add achievements for completing specific tasks or unlocking new ammo types or player skins.
#
# These ideas aim to build on the current foundation of Slingshot Hero, enhancing both gameplay depth and player engagement.
